Neotron started as a project called 'Monotron', by [@thejpster]. This was based on the work of the [Rust Embedded Working Group](https://github.com/rust-embedded), and inspiration from the following (in no particular order):

* [Colour Maximite](http://geoffg.net/maximite.html) - A modern PIC32 based single-board home computer.
* [PE6502](http://putnamelectronics.com/products.html) - A modern 6502 based single-board home computer.
* [Gigatron](https://gigatron.io/) - A single-board home computer, with a custom CPU built from TTL logic chips.
* [Commander X16](http://commanderx16.com/) - A single-board home computer, with a 6502 and an FPGA based video chip.
* [Craft](http://www.linusakesson.net/scene/craft/) - Demonstrates bit-bashing VGA from an AtMega88
* [AVR-ISA](http://tinyvga.com/avr-isa-vga) - Demonstrates driving an ISA bus (and an ISA VGA card) driven from an AtMega128
* The Commodore 64C - [@thejpster]'s first home computer
* The BBC Microcomputer range (the Model B through to the Archimedes A3000) - as used in UK schools in the 1980s
* The Amstrad range of CP/M machines, particularly the PCW9512

After meeting [@IGBC] at Oxidize 2019, discussions started around a next-generation system with higher performance. This led to the Neotron 1000, and then to the whole Neotron concept. We've also great benefited from conversations with [@jamesmunns], and others in the Rust Embedded Working Group.
