# Neotron Applications

Neotron Applications are loaded into RAM and then executed. For portability, they should use the API provided by the OS, but the system implements no security features or memory-protection, so once they are running, they have complete control of the entire system.

Existing applications include:

* A text-mode Snake game
* A 6502 emulator which runs 6502 Enhanced BASIC
* Tiny BASIC
* A slideshow/presentation tool
* A simple synthesiser which plays notes according to MIDI input
